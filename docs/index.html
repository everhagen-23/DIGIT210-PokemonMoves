        <h1>Our Research Question</h1>
        <figure class="blocka">
            <p>The specific question we are looking to address with our project is <i>how do
                    generations of pokemon differ in a.) how many moves they have and b.) the ratio
                    of types in said moveset.</i></p>

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <figure class="blocka">
            <p>This is the website for our Pokémon Moveset DIGIT-210 Project, in which we looked at
                data gathered from Pokémon Database to analyze the differences in Pokemon moves
                throughout the generations. Our data, methods, and findings have been sorted into
                different pages, all of which detail our processes and roadbumps. For this project
                we utilized oXygen for HTML, XSLT, and SVG, PyCharm for python, and Cytoscape for
                our network graphs. Some of our most interesting findings revolved around the amount
                of moves added per generation and the distribution of typings per generations. For
                instance, generation 8 only added moves to futher the Dynamax mechanic, and other
                generations introduced new typings (i.e. the dark and fairy typings), which could
                influence what types of moves were added. It was also interesting to see the status
                distribtion of different types, which offers insight into what niche they fill from
                a gameplay/battle standpoint.</p>
            <h2>Project Limitations</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately the amount of data that we were able to gather faced some surprising
                limitations that should be noted. We were shocked to find out that there is no
                easily accessible list of all pokemon moves availble in a generation, only lists of
                the newly added moves. It would take a great deal of time to have our group find and
                compile a list of all the moves in each generation, along with any changes in how
                the moves work, so we decided that this was not a good use of our time. </p>
            <p>This is the website for our DIGIT 210 Pokemon Moveset Project, in which we looked
                through pokemon moves throughout the generations and analyzed and reported on our
                findings. I will fill this section of the text out more when we have any findings to
                report.</p>

                <p>Hi! I'm Emma Verhagen and my favorite Pokémon generation is gen 5! I originally
                    pitched this project because I thought it would be interesting to see how
                    different generations handle different functionality and different move sets. As
                    a member of this team I primarily handled creating/designing the website and
                    creating visualizations in the form of SVGs. </p>
